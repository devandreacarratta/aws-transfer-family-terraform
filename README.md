This project shows how to create an SFTP server on AWS using Terraform and the AWS Transfer Family. It includes key generation, FileZilla configuration, and S3 integration for file uploads.

## Files

- **main.tf**: defines the provider and a local variable for general purposes

- **main_random.tf**: I love random naming conventions. In this case, I'm using the random_pet and random_string resources

- **main_transfer_server.tf**: this file contains the aws_transfer_server and aws_transfer_user resources

- **main_s3.tf**: defines the aws_s3_bucket and aws_s3_object resources

- **main_ssh_key.tf**: here I create the SSH key used for sFTP access

- **main_iam_role.tf**: if you donâ€™t set up IAM correctly, you wonâ€™t be able to use the solution

- **main_ftp_connector_filezilla_xml.tf**: Iâ€™m lazy and donâ€™t want to explain how to connect to an sFTP server, so I just upload a FileZilla importable file to the bucket
